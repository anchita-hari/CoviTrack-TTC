# CoviTrack Health Officials Portal

On this portal, health officials will see an accumulated list of all the COVID-19 positive cases that have been either self-reported through the CoviTracker app or verified
at the Schiffert Health Center or a local hospital. Doctors will have the option to verify a case based on symptoms a person is indicating.
